## Problem Statement: 
USE HISTORICAL PRICE AND SOCIAL MEDIA DATA TO PREDICT CRYPTO PRICE MOVEMENTS

## Introduction: 
The market for cryptocurrencies has exploded in recent years increasing the number of investors due to its substantial profit. The high fluctuation rate of these cryptocurrencies is also confusing many investors. The worth of a cryptocurrency unit climbs over the course of a week, but the price also of decreases over the same time. These events make it crucial to consider whether we can assist investors in lowering the level of uncertainty in their investing choices. This topic becomes even more difficult when we realize that these changes depend not only on historical pricing but also on other variables, including how society feels about cryptocurrencies. These days, this information is widely accessible thanks to the development of social media. Hence in this project, we take some steps by leveraging this information from online social network platforms to forecast the direction of the movement of the cryptocurrency asset (coin) using historical pricing data.
