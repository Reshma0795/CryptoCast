# Problem Description 
Machine learning research has employed several techniques in recent years to try and forecast the prices of cryptocurrencies. However, this task of predicting the prices themselves can be quite challenging due to the volatile nature of these assets. Thus, to create a viable solution, we aim to solve a simpler problem by looking to forecast only the direction of the movement of the cryptocurrency asset (coin) using historical pricing data. Moreover, with evidence of news as well as public forums having influenced their prices in the recent years, we believe that it would be interesting to bring into consideration a social media source to collect textual data to provide public sentiment which can be used for its predictive power to gain insight into how cryptocurrency prices fluctuate. In this project, our problem uses a supervised learning approach to perform a binary classification on time series data.
